The concept is a personal budgeting application that uses machine learning/AI to keep
track of expenses, learns spending patterns and recommends deviations to the userâ€™s day
or routine in order to save them money. It is called Agile Saver and it has been designed
for individuals who struggle to keep track of their expenses and find themselves unable to
save for the future or enjoy any disposable income. 

The team intends to implement a system whereby the user can receive relevant analysis of their
spending patterns and suggests to them areas in their spending that offers them a chance to save
money. The idea is for the user to download the application onto their phone, link to their bank in a
secure exchange of data to receive expense reports in real time. Through the android application,
the AI will then analyse the data and make suggestions to the user. The user can also make saving
goals, track their progress to completion with easy-to-understand visual graphs, set budgets, and
add multiple bank accounts for the AI to analyse as one. Through learning the spending patterns the
AI can then learn to predict an incoming expense and warn the user to be careful.
